### Duration: JUNE 29th, 2024 to JULY 29th, 2024
### Mentor: Neela Santhosh Kumar  


# Overview
During my internship at Codetech IT Solutions, I worked on two main tasks: a Quiz Game and a Temperature Converter. Below is a brief description of each task and how they were implemented in C++.

## Quiz Game
### Description
The Quiz Game is a console-based application that quizzes users with multiple-choice questions and provides feedback on their answers.

### Features
- Multiple-choice questions with randomized options.
- Score tracking for correct answers.
- User input validation to ensure accurate responses.

### Implementation
- Implemented using C++ programming language.
- Used object-oriented principles for organizing questions, options, and scoring.
- Used standard input and output for user interaction.

## Temperature Converter
### Description
The Temperature Converter is a utility that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales.

### Features
- Conversion between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales.
- Input validation to handle invalid temperature values.
- Support for bi-directional conversion (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa).

### Implementation
- Implemented in C++ to handle temperature conversion logic.
- Used functions to encapsulate conversion formulas.
- Ensured robust error handling for user input.
